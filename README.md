- 👋 Hi, I’m @**NessusTheInsane** *(I borrowed the name* '**Nessus**' *from one of* **Larry Niven**'s *characters frequently featured in his* '**Known Space**' *sci-fi novels).*
- 👀 I’m a lead developer, with a 1991 B.Sc. in CompSci. *(although I retired early, I still have decades worth of experience across several major industries)*.
- ❤️ My very favorite language is **Smalltalk-80**, but I haven't used it since University. It was so fun on the Sparc workstations *(except that they were too slow, and everything lagged).*
- 🌱 I **can't** say that I’m currently learning Swift, but it's something I would like to do!
- 🔧 The same can be said about developing apps across the *Apple* ecosystem.
- 💞️ I'm definitely *capable* of getting up to speed and collaborating on something, but I haven't written *any* code in over **10 years** *(yikes!)*, so I'm thinking divimg into this is a bit too soon.
- 📫 How to reach me ... *hmmm,* can you reach me thru GitHub somehow? *(I **just** created my free account on 04/18/22, and I know next to **zilch** about GitHub)*.
